You are building a **Minimal To-Do App MVP**.

### Tech Stack:

* **Frontend:** React.js (Next.js) + Tailwind UI
* **State Management:** React hooks (local state, no backend for MVP)
* **Persistence:** LocalStorage (so tasks remain after refresh)
* **Optional (not MVP):** Node.js/Express backend

### Requirements:

1. **Core Features (MVP):**

   * Add, edit, and delete tasks.
   * Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
   * Organize tasks by categories: **Work, Personal, Health**.
   * Minimal dashboard view showing all tasks.

2. **UI/UX Patterns:**

   * Clean, minimal design using Tailwind UI.
   * Task list should be card-based with checkboxes for completion.
   * Color-coded or labeled categories (Work = Blue, Personal = Green, Health = Red).
   * Floating “+” button (bottom right) for adding tasks.
   * Inline editing (click task text to edit).

3. **State Management:**

   * Use React hooks for managing tasks.
   * Store tasks in LocalStorage so they persist after refresh.

4. **Nice-to-Have Enhancements (optional for now):**

   * Filter/sort tasks by category or completion status.
   * Light/Dark mode toggle.

### Deliverables:

* A **Next.js project** scaffolded with TailwindCSS.
* A **dashboard page** (`/`) that lists all tasks.
* A **task component** with title, category, and status toggle.
* An **add task modal/form** triggered by “+” button.
* **LocalStorage integration** to save/load tasks.
